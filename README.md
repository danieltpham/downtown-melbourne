# Downtown Melbourne - Should City of Melbourne be divided into specialised industrial areas?
This project is submitted for assignment for the [Elements of Data Processing (COMP20008)](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2019/subjects/comp20008) course at The University of Melbourne as a Data Science subject.

#### -- Project Status: Completed October 2018

## Project Intro
Although Melbourne CBD is the robust trading centre of Victoria, it lacks a definitive area of industrial specialisation. A prime example is Wall Street in New York, which specialises in financial services business, or Madison Avenue which specialises in advertising industry. The specialisation in specific industry has brought positive investments and developments to other cities in the world.

The investigation question is: **Is Melbourne CBD predisposed (have the capability) to form industrial specialisation areas?**

## Dataset Description
The datasets used are collected from the *Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE)* reports from the City of Melbourne. Specifically, the predisposition is operationalised as both the number of businesses based on industry, the number of employees based on industry, the area blocks divided according to CLUE, and the population per area blocks. The timeframe of interest is 2017, but forecast into 2020 are also going to be predicted.

* [Establishments data 2017](https://github.com/danieltpham/downtown-melbourne/blob/Update-README/Count_of_business_establishments_per_industry_for_blocks_2017.csv)
* [Employment data ](https://github.com/danieltpham/downtown-melbourne/blob/Update-README/Employment_by_block_by_CLUE_industry.csv)
* [Population data](https://github.com/danieltpham/downtown-melbourne/blob/Update-README/Population_Forecasts_by_Small_Area.csv)

## Conclusions
Analysis on the current Employment & Population datasets of City of Melbourne reveals that there is little evidence for a predisposition for industrial specialisation in Melbourne CBD. Most employments and industries are highly concentrated in the CBD area, turning the most important area of the dataset to an outlier which challenges the interpretation. However, the analysis reveals a potential for Dockland to become the next Central Business District of Melbourne; and a strong focus on Business & Professional Services for City of Melbourne.
